# Terraform aws ecs cluster

This is another TODO app example, but using microservices.

- It uses python and FastApi for each microservice built upon Ports and Adapters architecture
- It has a SQL database (PostgreSQL)
- It also has also a NoSQL database (MongoDB)
- The services communicate using queues

## Usage

There is a directory with Makefiles for specific purposes, but they all can be called by a Makefile at the root directory of this project.

### Local Development

_The authentication service is based on Cognito, as localstack does not provide a free tier of it, it will not work, is not needed to run it_.

You can execute the command `docker-compose up` then `make apply-dkr-command-migrations``

#### Moto Server

We are using `moto server` to mock aws services, a dashboard can be seen at `http://localhost:5000/moto-api/`.

### Cloud Deploy

First you need to create the ecr repositories `ecs-todo-auth` and `ecs-todo-command` manually. Then run the command `make push`.

Each resource in `infrastructure/aws` can use the following commands with the directory as command suffix. But I recommend to follow an order.

1. vpc
2. cognito, rds and documentdb (in whenever the order you like it)
3. bastion
4. ecs
5. batch

A batch job must be submitted so the alembic migrations are applied to the PostgreSQL database. Tis can be achieved with the command `make apply-batch-command-migrations`. Then just access the **load balancer** url from _ecs_ `terraform` output with the path of the service followed by "docs" like `<load_balancer_url>/auth/docs`.

- **Terraform init**:

```sh
make tf-init-vpc
```

- **Terraform validate**:

```sh
make tf-validate-vpc
```

- **Terraform apply**:

```sh
make tf-apply-vpc
```

- **Terraform output**:

```sh
make tf-output-vpc
```

- **Terraform destroy**:

```sh
make tf-destroy-vpc
```

## Bastion Host

```sh
make ssh-bastion
```

### DocumentDB connection

```sh
mongosh mongodb://username:password@endpoint:27017
```

or

```sh
mongosh --host endpoint:27017 --username username --password password
```
